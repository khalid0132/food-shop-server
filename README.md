In server, I can insert and delete data from database. 
I created an Admin component where admin can insert product info into MongoDB. 
Users can directly see the inserted product information that admin has done but need to login where I used only google login system by firebase auth. 

At last but not at least, I wanna say----- need to spend a lot of time to develop myself. Thanks
